# PalBot - Your Palworld Server Companion
PalBot is a discord bot written in NodeJS.

It's aimed towards people who are hosting their own Palworld servers.

# Features
Newest feature: Whitelist
The bot will check every 5 minutes (changable in the index.js) if every user in the server is whitelisted.
The whitelist is disabled by default so if you want to change that, use the `/whitelist` command.

# Commands
`/Server` - Gives you basic informations about your Palworld server. Be aware though that the "current Players" is not always correct. Gamedig maybe fetches that wrong, not sure.

`/rcon-edit` - A simple way of managing the people that should be allowed to use the RCON commands. This is made possible through discords role system.

`/rcon` - This is where the magic happens. You're able to send messages to the server, save the server and also shut the server off.

`/whitelist` - Ability to enable/disable the whitelist.

`/whitelist-edit` - Gives you the option to add/remove users (steamId) from the whitelist.

`/players` - Displays a list of players, ther userId and their SteamId.

More commands are planned as soon as we get more informations on how the servers exactly work!


__Warning__

If you don't have an automatic startup script for your server, please be aware that there is no way to restart the server via the bot (for now)!
